% SPELLING CHECK
% (Research questions:
% - From theory, which variables are important for extreme precipitation to occur?
% - Which variables correlate well with precipitation extremes?
% - Do these variables change signifcantly in time?
% - Does only the distribution change in time or does the relation with precipitation intensity change?
% Concluding;

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we attempt to find an explanation for the observed intensification of hourly precipitation extremes, % and decrease in frequency of wet hours
and the decrease in the occurrence of wet hours. In order to find a mechanism we apply a fourfold analysis. Firstly, we identify key variables by describing their relationship to (extreme) precipitation, as found from theory. Secondly, correlation matrices of these variables are plotted to provide a first-hand overview of the strength of any possible relationships. Thirdly, we regress the key variables in time, in order to investigate whether we find changes in time that might explain the observed changes for precipitation. We bundle the data for all five stations to improve the detection of relationships, except for CAPE data of which we only have data from one station, number 260 De Bilt. Moreover, we compare the magnitude and sign of these trends with the observed trends found in Chapter 3 (REF CH3). Lastly, we plot the distribution of the variable in question and the quantile regression lines for intensity over the remaining variable(s) for two different time periods. By comparing the two periods for both plots we can validate whether the distribution of the variable or its relation with precipitation extremes changes in time. In this part we differentiate between summer and winter season to understand the seasonal dependency of the causes of increasing intensity of heavy hourly precipitation and decreasing precipitation time.\\ % Lastly, we consider spatial differences in the explanatory variable(s) to explain spatial differences in the intensity , frequency and precipitation sum trends

\section{Detection of key variables}

\subsection{Theory}
\label{subsec:theory}
In this section we describe the relation of multiple variables to (extreme) precipitation. These are temperature, relative humidity, dewpoint temperature, convective available potential energy, wind strength, cloud condensation nuclei, topography, and weather code.\\

\subsubsection{Temperature} \label{subsubsec:T}
Since 1950 many of the observed changes in temperature are unprecedented on a time scale of decades to millennia. For the period 1880-2012 the \citet{IPCC2013} stated that the linear trend in temperature shows a warming of 0.85$^\circ$C. For more recent data (1951-1989) the relative increase is higher, with a rate of 0.92$^\circ$C/century. \\

Temperature at the surface, as well as the gradient of the temperature with height, influences precipitation intensity and occurrence in many ways. It plays a role into the entire chain, from the source of moisture, cloud formation and precipitation production up to and including the falling process \citep{Sumner1988}.\\

First, in order to produce precipitation, atmospheric moisture needs to be available. In general, the higher the temperature, the more evaporation can take place, and the more moisture is supplied to the atmosphere. Note that the surface temperature cools, as evaporation consumes latent heat.\\

Second, the ability of air to hold water vapor increases with temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. However, air does not absorb water vapor, so this is correctly phrased as: a higher temperature results in a higher equilibrium vapor pressure \citep[p.80,81]{Wallace2006}. The effect of this relation is that when temperature increases in a changing climate, saturation will occur less often (e.g. the saturation level is harder to reach)\citep[p.80,81]{Wallace2006}, but under extreme conditions more moisture can fall down as precipitation from an air column \citep{Pall2007,Lenderink2010,Hardwick2010,Lenderink2011}. Further elaboration on air's ability to hold moisture linked to (extreme) precipitation will follow in Section \ref{subsubsec:moist}.\\

Third, from Chapter TB (REF CH TB) we know that cloud droplet formation depends on the equilibrium vapor pressure, so indirectly on the internal temperature of the cloud. In short, both the amount of available atmospheric moisture, and cloud formation depends on the temperature.\\

Fourth, a strong temperature gradient with warm air at the surface and cold air aloft leads to buoyant and vertical unstable air. The strength of updrafts is determined by the strength of instability of the air. A measure of the vertical instability is the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). As we have data of CAPE, we will further discuss its relation to temperature in the following paragraph. Lastly, processes within a cloud regarding droplet growth depend on the internal temperature and temperature differences (REF TB).\\

To summarize, an increase in temperature might cause an increase in extreme precipitation and a decrease in the amount of wet hours, via changes in the atmospheric temperature gradient, dewpoint temperature and CAPE.\\% WHAT EXACTLY EFFECT, more or stronger precipitation???

% we can also distinguish clouds based on their temperature: warm and cold clouds. Warm clouds are limited in formation, only beneath the 0 degrees Celsius isotherm. So that they only comprise water droplets in the stable phase, with coalescence involved in the production of precipitation. Therefore, these clouds have a lower vertical extent at middle and high latitudesthan at low latitudes. The higher intensity and amount of precipitation produced by warm clouds, is confined tot the warmer seasons and lower latitudes. So not really intense at high-latitude, only in summer \citep[110-111]{Sumner1988}. Clouds with a large vertical extent at mid-latitude, mainly have mixed-phase processes regarding droplet growth. Besides, convective precipitation is more intense and occurs more at higher temperaturethan stratiform precipitation \citep{Berg2013}.

% Third, the urban heat island effect is a temperature-driven phenomenon with associated characterstics in precipitation. Warm urban areas with enhanced convection can be compared to small island with sea-breeze systems, as cool surface air is drawn from rural areas inwards to feed the enhanced convection near the urban centre \citep[188]{Sumner1988}. Precipitation incidence and intensity may be enhanced in cities, as is demonstrated by \citet{Atkinson1975,Atkinson1977} for London. ALSO FOR NL CITIES?  The temperature is higher due to the lower albedo (urban fabrics and building materials) and the urban surface has a relatively high roughness which increases heat absorption and reduces wind speed. Not only the temperature, but also the concentration of CCN is higher in urban areas. \citet{Changnon1976} have indicated 25 \% higher summer (convectional) precipitation in urban areas, relative to the surrounding suburbs and countryside \citep[110-111]{Sumner1988}.



\subsubsection{Relative humidity and Dewpoint temperature}
\label{subsubsec:moist}
The specific humidity is the ratio between the mass of the water vapor in the sample and the total mass of the sample. It gives the actual amount of water vapor in an air sample \citep{Sumner1988}. The specific humidity gives an indication about the level of saturation for a certain temperature and pressure. \\

An increase in water vapor of a saturated air parcel without changing temperature or pressure will result in oversaturation. Most of the time air must be at least saturated for condensation to occur, leading to cloud or fog formation \citep{Sumner1988}. The moment that the water vapor pressure ($e$) rises till the point it equals the saturation vapor pressure ($e=e_s$), an equilibrium exist between the rate of condensation and evaporation and air is said to be saturated with respect to a plane surface of pure water at temperature T, and the pressure $e_s$ \citep[12-13]{Markowski2010}, \citep[80-81]{Wallace2006}. The expression of $e_s$ in T is called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
\begin{equation}
\frac{d e_s}{d T} = \frac{L_v e_s}{R_v T^2},
\end{equation}
in which $L_v$ is the specific latent heat of vaporization and $R_v$ the gas constant for water vapor ($R_v = 461.51 J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$) \citep{Bolton1980}.\\

We can deduce from Figure \ref{fig:e_s} that the saturation vapor pressure increases rapidly with temperature. This means that more water vapor can be present in warmer air without reaching saturation. Therefore, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation predicts that under the constraint of constant relative humidity \citep{Ingram2002}, an increasing temperature leads to an exponential increase in specific humidity %, which is the ratio of the mass of water vapor that could be held in saturation to the total mass of saturated air
\citep{Trenberth1999,Allen2002,Pall2007,Pierrehumbert2007}. And the heaviest rainfall events are likely to occur when all available moisture in a volume of air precipitates effectively. Therefore, we might expect the highest quantiles of the rainfall probability density function to increase in ratio with the Clausius Clapeyron equation \citep{Pall2007}.\\

To investigate the change of the saturation vapor pressure with increasing temperature we took the derivative of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to temperature. Figure \ref{fig:Des_dt} demonstrates that a certain increase in temperature has a larger impact on the saturation vapor pressure for colder temperatures than for warmer temperatures. For T $< 0^{\circ}$C $e_s$ increases with more  than 7\%, while for temperatures higher than 20$^{\circ}$ Celsius it is less than 6\%. For this reason we would expect that any trends in extremes caused by global warming-induced changes in moisture-holding capacity are stronger visible for winter than for summer.\\ %(ADD this is confirmed or not confirmed by CH2 in which we compared the relative rates of summer vs winter; Look at magnitude differences between summer and winter trends!!).

%From Chapter 2 we learned that this is not the case. It could be because of different winter and summer mechanisms, where f.e. the summer precipitation is more dependent on relative humidity.

% (Reminding that $RH = e/e_s$, we can investigate what the percential change in relative humidity is for the whole temperature range for 1 degree Celsius increase.)

Dewpoint temperature is a widely used measure for the amount of moisture in the air \\
\citep{Lawrence2005}. The dewpoint temperature (Td) is the temperature to which air at initial temperature and pressure must be cooled isobarically to become saturated, and can be expressed in terms of the vapor pressure $e_s(Td) = e(t)$ \citep{Lawrence2005}. An expression of the dewpoint temperature in terms of relative humidity is,
% \begin{equation}
% T_d = T \left[ 1- \frac{T ln(\frac{RH}{100})}{\frac{L_v}{R_v}}  \right]^{-1}
% \end{equation}
% which can rewritten to
\begin{equation}
T_d = \frac{T} {1- \frac{T ln(\frac{RH}{100})}{L_v R_v}}
\end{equation}
\\

When relative humidity is assumed to be constant in time \citep{Pall2007} and the temperature rises, the numerator will increase, the term $\frac{T ln(\frac{RH}{100})}{L_v R_v}$ will increase, so that the denumerator ($1-$ term $\uparrow$) will decrease. As the change in Td is the product of an increase in the numerator and a decrease in the denumerator, Td will increase. %(! maybe more sources)
So indeed the atmospheric moisture, indicated by Td, will rise under constraint of constant relative humidity and rising temperature.\\


\subsubsection{Convective Available Potential Energy}
\label{subsubsec:CAPE}

% Lastly, vertical uplift is also determined by the temperature of the air. The higher the temperature of air at the surface relative the air above it, the more buoyant and vertical instable the air is. A measure of the vertical instability is the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). As CAPE is also available in our metadata, we will further discuss it's relation to temperature in the following paragraph.

As explained in the theoretical background section (REF Chapter TB) initial cooling of moist air is a prerequisite in the formation of clouds. This occurs often in the process of vertical uplift, such that rising air cools adiabatically with height. Rising of air occurs as a result of density differences. \\

If we exclude mixing of air with its environment, we can consider the thought experiment of a rising air parcel. The air parcel will rise as long as the temperature of the surrounding air is lower than its own. Buoyancy is then given by: $a = (T_p - T_0 ) g / T_0$.  With $a$, the buoyancy, $T_p$, the internal temperature of the air parcel, $T_0$, the external temperature and g, the acceleration due to gravity \citep[55-56]{Sumner1988}. Thus, for convection to occur an air parcel must have enough potential energy, which is indicated by the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). CAPE represents namely the vertically integrated positive buoyancy of a parcel experiencing adiabatic ascent,
\begin{equation}
CAPE = g \int_{z_LCL}^{z_LNB} B dz
\end{equation}
in which g is the acceleration due to gravity (m s$^{-2}$), $z_{LCL}$ the lifted condensation level, $z_{LNB}$ the level of no buoyancy and B the buoyancy force. This can also be expressed, similar to Chapter (REF CH Method), as:
\begin{equation}
CAPE = g \int_{z_1}^{z_2} \frac{T - \bar{T}}{\bar{T}} dz
\end{equation}
with $T$, the temperature of the air parcel, and $\bar{T}$, the temperature of the environment. The units for CAPE are $J/kg$.\\

The LCL is the height till which an air parcel follows a dry adiabat when lifted upwards. Further lifting leads to condensation of the air parcel, which will then follow the wet adiabat \citep{Lin2007}. In other words, condensation releases latent heat, which warms the air parcel, so that an air parcel will continue to rise further due to its enhanced buoyancy with respect to its environment. The LCL thus depends on the moisture content of air. The LNB is the height at which the buoyancy of the air parcel equals the buoyancy of the surrounding air, so that the air parcel has lost its potential energy to rise further. As CAPE represents the potential energy of an air parcel, it can be read from a thermodynamic diagram, as proportional to the area between the LFC and LNB enclosed by the environmental temperature curve and the wet adiabat of the air parcel. A necessity for convection is that the air parcel is forced to the LCL, for which the amount of supplied energy is called the convective inhibition (CIN) \citep{Lin2007}. In summary, CAPE can be seen as a measure for potentially buoyancy-driven vertical motion.\\

% (((Something about conditional instability % %From: http://www.zamg.ac.at/docu/Manual/SatManu/main.htm?/docu/Manual/
% Not all situations with conditional instability are characterised by air parcels with CAPE. Thus, the moisture content of the air is important for knowing whether conditional instability actually contains the potential for parcels to become buoyant. In that case, an external source of energy must be supplied to the air mass to convert its potential instability into actual instability and lift the parcel through its condensation level to its Level of Free Convection (LFC) - that means, for instance, the change from potential instability to conditional instability. The amount of this supplied energy is known as the Convective Inhibition (CIN).
% From the LFC to the Equilibrium Level (EL), the parcel accelerates vertically, drawing the energy for this acceleration from the CAPE. )))

In pre-thunder conditions CAPE values can range from a few hundreds up to thousands of $\frac{J}{kg}$, with maxima on the order of 5000-7000 J kg$^{-1}$ \citep{ManualSynop}. The Storm Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) divides CAPE values in four classes: "weak instability" (CAPE less than 1000 J kg$^{-1}$), "moderate instability" (CAPE between 1000-2500 J kg$^{-1}$), "strong instability" (CAPE from 2500-4000 J kg$^{-1}$) and "extreme instability" (CAPE greater than 4000 J kg$^{-1}$)(\citep{SPCNOAA}). Studying CAPE is considered as an indicator of the probability of occurrence and the intensity of deep, moist convection \citep{ManualSynop}.\\

Assuming zero horizontal advection the maximum vertical velocity of an air parcel is reached when all the potential energy is released into kinetic energy \citet{Lin2007}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
W_{max} = \sqrt 2 CAPE
\end{equation}
The definition of CAPE does not include the existence of liquid water loading, entrainment, the vertical motions in the air or aerodynamic effects, which all decrease the value of CAPE. Therefore, in the real world CAPE is usually an overestimation of the vertical instability and of updraft strength {\citep{ManualSynop,SPCNOAA}}. The updrafts of supercells can nonetheless be much stronger than indicated by CAPE, due to vertical shear effects \citep{Mccaul2001,SVRNOAA}.\\

As already explained in \ref{subsubsec:T} an increase in the present and/or strength of the updrafts, which is characterized by the degree of CAPE, can lead to enhanced moisture influx. This leads to more intense or longer showers depending on the conditions of precipitation production. In Chapter TB (REF) we stated that precipitation associated with convection is relatively intense. In brief, higher CAPE corresponding to higher probability of occurrence and stronger convection might cause higher intensity of precipitation and/or higher amount of wet hours.\\

% ((CAPE can also be calculated with starting integration level not being the LFC, but instead, either a fixed level (e.g. 850 hPa), a lifted condensation level (LCL) or a convective condensation level (CCL). \citep{ManualSynop}
% The estimates of maximum updraft strength (Wmax) based on CAPE are usually twice as high as in observed updrafts because of water loading and mixing effects. In well-organized convective storms, vertical velocity in updrafts are much closer to Wmax. \citep{SVRNOAA}))


\subsubsection{Wind shear and strength}

The strength of wind speed is determined by the horizontal temperature-related pressure gradient \citep{Bonan2015} and CAPE-associated convergence of air \citep{Ahrens2012}. \citet{Smits2005} concluded that for the period 1962-2002 the wind speed for the Netherlands has decreased.\\

Severe local storms are associated with wind shear, pronounced shifts in wind speeds and/or direction with height \citep{Browning1964,Wingo2010}. The four types of storms distinguished on the way of development are: supercell, multicell, a collection of numerous individual precipitation cells as for example squall-line storms and mesoscale convective complexes \citep[p. 156]{Sumner1988}. Some of these storms can develop into larger storms delivering an hour or two of very intense precipitation at a point. A storm can obtain a self-perpetuating character due to pronounced wind shear, as this permits the continual introduction of fresh and moist air into the system at the lower-level developing edge and the venting of used air aloft, while the downdraft remains separated from the updraft \citep[p. 156]{Sumner1988}. Wind shear is therefore related to the lifetime of a storm (up to several hours). \\

Unfortunately we do not have observations of wind speed at higher levels for our time period of 58 years, so we can analyse changes of the wind shear in time for a certain station. Instead we can study the horizontal wind speed at 10 m, and use this an indicator of wind shear. Higher wind speeds also lead to faster propagation of fronts and local showers over a station. Therefore, we would expect a higher intensity. However, we could also argue the other way around, weak wind speeds or fast turning of the wind around a location can result in a longer duration of an intensive precipitation system over a station. In a back-building or occlusion event, high hourly precipitation sums can accumulate \citep{Schumacher2005,Lupikasza2016}.\\

In other words, changes in wind speed could influence the intensity of precipitation in two ways; (i) via the organisation of a storm under restriction of strong wind shear, and (ii) via the way of propagation of precipitation systems over a station.\\

\subsubsection{Other important variables}

Three variables which are further important to explain changes in precipitation extremes, but not used in this research for different reasons, are (i) the distribution, type and size of cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs), (ii) the topography and (iii) the weather type. We will briefly describe their relationships, so we may suggest possible explanations of the spatial differences found in CH1 (REF CH1). Moreover, we can keep them in mind in the case we cannot explain changes in (extreme) precipitation by the changes in the aforementioned variables only.\\

First, the presence of CCNs is vital to cloud formation, and the concentration of CCNs may have an impact on the probability of occurrence or intensity of precipitation. Many of the CCNs are aerosols, very small particles or liquid droplets that are suspended in the air for a long time and that form nuclei on which condensation can occur. Their size is on the order 0.1 to 1 micron and they originate from industrial pollution or natural sources as sea salt spraying or dimethyl sulfide emission from oceans \citep{Sumner1988}. The bigger the size of an CCN, the lower the saturation vapor pressure above its surface, and the higher the preference for condensation compared to evaporation. Bonding forces are namely stronger for CCNs that are less curved (REF CH TB). Whether aerosols are hygroscopic also determines how easily condensation can take place. \\

The concentration of aerosols over oceans and the coast is small in this comparatively clean air environment, but their size is often large, so that precipitation-sized droplets may easily form. In contrary, the air over continental areas contains more nuclei from terrestrial sources, which differ more in size. This results in a larger minimum cloud thickness for shower development, as moisture is spread among more and smaller aerosols.\\

% Describe trend in CCN with climate change??
We do not posses data about CCNs distribution and properties. Therefore, in our study of the causes of changes in precipitation we can not take into account the effect of changes in CCNs. Overall, the distribution, size and type of CCN is important for cloud formation, and indirectly for precipitation production. \\

Second, topography plays an important role in the distribution and intensity of precipitation. At temperate latitudes warm sectors in frontal depressions or mesoscale systems can be moderately intensive, when uplifted by relief \citep{Sumner1988}. Although the enhanced magnitude and extent of precipitation due to relief is governed by the height and longitudinal extent of the relief barrier, low hills of only tens of meters in height can lead to notable increases in precipitation \citep{Bergeron1968,Sumner1988}. Even for the Netherlands, where gradients are relatively small, notable precipitation increases are detected by \citet{Maat2013} for the area of the Veluwe. Despite the fact that the topography in the Veluwe has an maximum elevation of only just over 100 m and moderate steepness. The differences in monthly domain-averaged precipitation sums between the Veluwe and its surroundings, are 17\% in winter and 10\% in summer. Next to the Veluwe, the southern part of the country also has a higher elevation with a maximum of approximately 325 m. \\

In our study the station at Maastricht has the highest elevation (114 m see REF CH Method). This might explain that the highest precipitation intensities were measured at this station. However, we do not have enough stations with spatial differences in topography, to analyse the effect of topography on the intensity and occurrence of precipitation. Moreover, as topographic gradients are not expected to change significantly in time, this is not an appropriate variable to study trends in hourly precipitation extremes. In short, even small-elevation differences in the Netherlands can lead to significant spatial differences in hourly precipitation extremes. On the one hand, we are interested in trends, and thus, these can not be explained by topographic gradients, which are constant for the time scale we look at. On the other hand, we can reason why we observed the highest extreme intensities at Maastricht (REF CH1).\\

 % Production of precipitation tied to a specific topographic barrier is called orographic precipitation. This type is is not spatially mobile and considerable amounts of precipitation may accumulate in restricted regions, namely on the windward side of the topographic barrier. The strongest orographic rainfalls are caused by a sustained and deep, moist flow against a relief barrier, so the magnitude is dependent on the local lower trospheric circulation and its stability.  \citep{Sumner1988}.
% Factors of importance to orographic precipitation are: 1) Relative humidity and ϑe (equivalent potential temperature) and ϑw (wet-bulb potential temperature) of low-level air, 2) slope of the hill perpendicular tot he mountain, 3) strength of the wind component normal to the mountain, 4) depth of the feeder cloud, 5) precipitation rate from the feeder cloud, 6) rate of production condensate in the feeder cloud, 7) cloud water content and 8) rate of accretion or washout by the precipitation emanating from the seeder cloud \citep{Cotton1989}.

% Soil
% The occurrence of more weak wet hours and less extreme wet hours in Eelde, as observed in Section \ref{subsec:Spatial}, might be explained by the non-coastal and low geographic position. The most intense rain events are likely not only dependent on strong updrafts, but also on the supply of moisture. The sea can be seen as a large moisture source for a station located downwind of the sea. Eelde is located farther downwind from the sea, where a more land (i.e. dry) climate is present. This could explain the relatively lower frequency of precipitation extremes with intensities on the order of $> 2$ mm/hr. However, Maastricht is also situated relatively far downwind from the sea, but at this station the highest extremes have occurred. Another soil type (loam for Maastricht) might explain this, as soil type influences the saturation level of a soil and thereby the strength of the evaporation \citep{Wilson1997} and latent heat fluxes \citep{Seneviratne2010}.Although 60\% of all precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration (e.g. \citet{Oki2006}), mechanical studies
% (e.g. \citet{Eltahir1998,Schar1999,Pal2001,Taylor2006,Hohenegger2009}) have shown that soil moisture influences precipitation more via boundary-layer stability and precipitation formation than via the presence of absolute moisture \citep{Seneviratne2010}. So, precipitation, which  has an oceanic origin, may be enhanced over wet soils due to higher instability. On the other hand dry soils have higher sensible heat fluxes, which can result in stronger updrafts \citep{Westra2012,Daniels2014}. In this thesis, we shall not use soil moisture as a proxy to explain precipitation (extremes), although we can capture the latter precipitation-soil moisture feedback in the measure of CAPE. Note that as CAPE data exist for only one data, spatial differences for this relation can not be studied. Other likely causes for the high extremes measured at Maastricht, are slightly higher (summer) temperature and the presence of relief (REF method chapter), stimulating vertical motion (updrafts), which leads to more local and intense rain events. We will test this relationship with vertical motion, by analyzing the correlation of extreme precipitation with CAPE (REF to CH3).

Third, human-made visual observations indicated by "present weather" (WW) codes are available in our data . With help of this code, which is approved by the World Meteorological Organization, 100 different weather types are distinguished by two-digit numbers (0-99)(see \citet{Dai2001} for a complete list). Heavy precipitation is related to certain conditions in the cloud and at the surface. Two weather types, differentiated on WW, often occurring simultaneously with intense precipitation are (i) hail, and (ii)  thunderstorms.\\

(i) The majority of severe local storms associated with self-perpetuating convectional systems, are characterized by significant hail production \citep{Sumner1988}.  For the production of hail deep and strong convection is required. Convectional precipitation, which is often intense in nature, is mostly produced by the Bergeron-Findeisen process. This stems from the fact that very intense precipitation (sometimes in form of hail or ice pellets) is resultant from the considerable vertical development of the clouds (such that the cloud height exceeds the $0^\circ$C isotherm). \\%The following criteria can be used as a guideline for hail prediction: (1) cumulonimbus tops are colder than $-20^{\circ}$C and (2) the temperature path curve of the parcel is $4^{\circ}$C warmer than the environment curve just in between the LFC and EL and this gives cloud tops of 4500 meter. Another method, based on parcel curve, is: (1) measure the temperature difference at the point where the curve reaches $-20^{\circ}$C with the environment temperature. (2) if this difference is $\ge 5^{\circ}$C forecast hail, between $5-2.5^{\circ}$C forecast soft hail or rain and $\le 2.5^{\circ}$C$ forecast rain \citep{Brown1963,Ludlam1980,MET1997}.

(ii) Lightning occurs in vigorous convective clouds, in which ice particles and hail are thought be key players in charge generation. The majority of the lightning discharge originates from thunderstorms extending above the freezing level. However, for all-water clouds there are also well-documented UK observations of lightning events \citep{Atkinson1989,Lee1986,Mason1972,MET1997}. \\

Although we have hourly measurements of weather codes, we do not use them in this study, because %of two reasons. First, we want to find a reason for the changing intensity of heavy precipitation and frequency of wet hours. The weather codes indicate the weather types related to heavy precipitation, but not the causes of it. Therefore, we will not be able to explain the observed trends by trends in weather types. Nonetheless, a large vertical extent is needed for hail production, but in fact we already have CAPE as a measurement for vertical velocity and potential strength of convection. Second
in the course of time visual measurements of weather codes are automatized, and these are computed from different variables among which intensity \citep{Rulfova2013}. Differentiation between variables on basis of the automatic WW measurements would not have a physical meaning when attempting to explain differences in intensity.\\

\subsubsection{Summary theory}
To summarize, an increase in temperature leads potentially to more atmosphere moisture via evaporation, but with a negative feedback on the temperature, and a higher ability of the air to hold moisture. The latter is expressed in the dewpoint temperature and goes hand in hand with an expected decrease in the amount of wet hours and a concentration of precipitation in the more intense wet hours. The influx of moisture may also by enhanced by stronger updrafts, of which CAPE is a measure, via larger atmospheric temperature gradients. The strength of wind speed, which is temperature and CAPE related, influences precipitation intensity via the organisation of storms under condition of strong wind shear and the way precipitation systems propagate over a station. Stronger wind speeds correspond to higher extreme precipitation, except for situations in which back-building convection or occlusion occurs. Although, precipitation production depends on the concentration and size of CCNs, the internal temperature in a cloud, and the topography, no research is dedicated to these variables due to restriction in the vertical and horizontal extent of our data.\\


\subsection{Identification of relationships}

\subsubsection{Introduction}
In this part we try to identify relationships explaining the trends found in hourly precipitation in Chapter 2 (REF CH2). First, we start with a study of correlations and the type of relationship (e.g. linear or non-linear) for the variables described as important to precipitation intensity in Section \ref{subsec:theory}. Next, we compare trends in the key variable(s) to the observed trends in hourly intensity. Lastly, we study temporal changes in the seasonal distribution of the key variable(s) and in their relationships with precipitation intensity. %Our analysis is followed by plotting and interpreting lags. To find the best model for precipitation data the most promising variables are combined in multiregression plots.
Note that in this chapter we include duration data, in which duration is defined as the hourly fraction of time that precipitation occurs, to find the true precipitation intensity (PI). This allows us to distinguish between hours with the same precipitation sum, of which one is very intense and short-lasting, and the other less intense and long-lasting. Here, P is the hourly precipitation sum. \\

To have an easy and clear overview of the strength of relationships between multiple variables, we plotted heatmaps of the Pearson correlation coefficients. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a widely used statistic giving a measure of the strength of linear relationships \citep{Zou2003}. A heatmap shows the strength of all relationships between the following 7 variables: PI, I, DR (duration of precipitation within an hour), T, Td, FH (10m-wind strength, averaged as last 10 minutes of an hour), RH (relative humidity) and CAPE. For all variables, except for CAPE, we combined the measurements of the five stations, in order to clarify the relationships. We considered only wet hours, as we are interested in the relationship between the occurrence or intensity of wet hours and not in the occurrence of dry hours.\\

For CAPE only measurements of station De Bilt are available (REF CH method). Next to a different spatial resolution, CAPE measurements also have a different time length (1993-2015) and temporal resolution. Therefore, we plotted the relationships with CAPE in a separate heatmap (Figure \ref{fig:CAPE_p}), which of which the correlation coefficients are computed from all days on which CAPE is measured at least once. We added variable N, the number of CAPE measurements a day. Observed CAPE values have high daily variability, but CAPE is measured 1-6 times a day, so that this daily variability is not always captured. Next to the fact that large CAPE can result in intense precipitation, CAPE also decreases due to cold precipitation (negative feedback). This is described in Chapter TB (REF CH TB) as the interception of updrafts (which need vertical instability) by cold downdrafts. For these reasons we compared daily CAPE maxima in two different ways with precipitation; (i) to the cumulative daily precipitation sum, and (ii) to the daily or 2-day maxima in precipitation sum and intensity. From Section \ref{subsec:theory} we expect positive relationships between the variables T, Td, FH and CAPE with P and I. Next to comparison of all wet hour values, we also looked at the correlation coefficients for the wet 2-day maxima.\\
% From section \ref{subsubsec:CAPE} can be deduced that CAPE, as a representative for the strength of vertical motion, is an important factor for convective precipitation. Due to the different length and resolution of this dataset we plot an extra heat map consisting of CAPE values and I, P, T and the number of CAPE measurements a day (N). We included T to investigate in more details the indirect relationship of T with P or I via CAPE.

  \label{fig:Heatmap_allp}
\end{wrapfigure}

Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap_allp} provides an overview of the Pearson correlation coefficients for all variables, except CAPE, for all wet hours. The two highest coefficients are between T and TD (0.97) and P and I (0.75). %The strength of these relationships is pretty comprehensible for wet hours.
The strong relationship between T and TD (dewpoint temperature) is straight forward; following the definition of dew point temperature itself: the dewpoint temperature is the temperature till which air has to be cooled to become saturated. For moist air (RH$>50$\%) the following rule of thumbs holds: the dewpoint temperature decreases with $\pm 1^\circ$C for every 5\% decrease in relative humidity. As the data considered in this chapter only contains the wet hours, most of them will fulfill the assumption of a moist air and therefore a strong linear correlation is present. This corresponds to Pearson correlation coefficient of almost 1. \\

The hourly precipitation sum (P) is the product of the hourly duration, DR, and intensity, PI. The relationship between PI and I is stronger (0.75) than the relationship between PI and DR (0.35). % because I is computed from PI and DR
The third highest coefficient is the one between DR and RH (0.38). The higher the relative humidity, the higher the percentage of saturation at a certain temperature. Apparently this percentage says more about the duration of precipitation within an hour than about the magnitude of the precipitation sum (or precipitation intensity PI). Higher RH is partially related to longer durations of precipitation within an hour, which could mean that with higher saturation it generally takes longer before precipitation stops due to undersaturation. However, there are of course also events where RH is high and the precipitation intensive, this explains why the coefficient is not super high. \\ % It is also explainable that this coefficient is not higher than 0.38, as there are also short-lastig, high intensity precipitation events.

What is more striking from Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap_allp} is the relatively high negative correlation between RH and FH. So the lower the wind speed, the high the relative humidity. The reason for this relation is uncertain, but it could be that low wind speeds at the time and place of a large precipitation system results in stationarity of moist air.\\  %This could mean that with high wind speed at the moment of precipitation, the frontal or other precipitation system is blown over quickly. However, then DR is excepted to have a relatively high correlation with FH, which is not the case. On contrast, high horizontal wind speeds also occur at times of strong vertical mixing when contrasting winds converge at the place where air is lifted.

Four other positive correlation coefficients, which are a bit higher than the rest, are those between (i) PI and T, (ii) PI and Td, (iii) I and T, and (iv) I and Td. From Section \ref{subsec:theory} we know that temperature can influence precipitation amount (P) and intensity (PI) via enhanced evaporation and updrafts and higher ability of air to hold moisture. As evaporation is important at the place and time of moisture influx, it could be that this relation holds a remote and lagged relationship. Hence, the relation does not have to be strong (coefficient of 0.15) when comparing temperature and precipitation measured at the same time and only on the location of precipitation accumulation. However, more and counteracting relationships can play a role. The relationship between P or I and T via enhanced updrafts should also be present in the relationship between CAPE and P or I. For De Bilt we plotted the CAPE 2-day maxima in relationship to other 2-day maxima and the cumulative 2-day precipitation sum (see Figure \ref{CAPE2d_p}).\\

The relationship between maxima in CAPE and T is indeed relatively strong for a time scale of 2 days and for the Bilt, as can be deduced from the relatively high correlation coefficient (0.35) in Figure \ref{fig:CAPE2d_p}. The highest correlation between 2-day CAPE and precipitation variables (Figure \ref{fig:CAPE2d_p}), is the one between the 2-day maxima in CAPE and precipitation intensity (0.14). N shows the effect of the number of CAPE measurements a 2 days on the magnitude of the CAPE 2-day maxima, which is just as strong as the relation between CAPEmax2d and PImax2d, but weaker than the relation between 2-day CAPE and temperature or dewpoint temperature.\\

As we studied the maxima in mean hourly precipitation intensity (P) for independent 2-day periods in Chapter 3 (REF CH trends), we included the correlation coefficients for 2-day maxima in P (and in true precipitation intensity, PI, and the 2-day precipitation sum, Psum)  in relation to the 2-day maxima in T, Td, FH, and RH (Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap_max2d}). Eventually we want to explain the observed trends found in Chapter 3. Therefore, it is relevant to investigate the correlation coefficients for the same temporal resolution. Besides, this approach zooms in more on the precipitation extremes, as 2-day maxima are considered. Keep into mind that the maxima of the different variables do not have to be measured at the same moment in time. On the one hand, this can enhance correlations in a biased way, if the hours are widely spaced in time. On the other hand, lower correlation coefficients are found when we look at correlation between 2-day maxima in P and the variables T, TD, and FH, measured at the time of the maximum in P. Negative feedback is then assumed to play a role, as for example cooling of the air due to precipitation. Analysis of the lags between the different maxima, showed that the maxima mainly occur at the same time up to 3 hours lags. Besides, the extremes in precipitation are often of the convective type, which is restricted to the hours that insolation is strongest. \\

We observe the same relationships which are relative high as in Figures \ref{fig:Heatmap_allp} and \ref{fig:CAPE_p}, which are stronger in Figures \ref{fig:Heatmap_max2d,fig:Heatmap_maxip,fig:CAPE2d_p}. This shows that the relationships are stronger for the extremes. Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap_max2d} shows correlation coefficients of 0.28 and 0.36 for the relations between the 2-day maxima in hourly precipitation sums (P) and 2-day maxima in T and Td. Hence,the theory in which precipitation intensity relates to the ability of air to hold moisture, matches with the relatively high correlation coefficient (0.38) between 2-day maxima in PI and TD, with the latter as measure of moisture.\\

Even higher coefficients (0.32-0.38) are found when the 2-day maxima in precipitation intensities are considered instead of P (Figure \ref{fig:Heatmap_max2d}). The correlation coefficients between precipitation 2-day maxima and CAPE are lower, 0.11-0.14. \\

In fact, the largest changes in magnitude of the correlation coefficients, when switching from all-hour to 2-day maxima, are detected for wind speed (FH of 0.01-0.03 to 0.44). Especially the correlation between the 2-day maxima in FH and the 2-day precipitation sum is high (0.44). 2-day precipitation sum correspond more to long-lasting precipitation events than maxima in hourly precipitation sum and intensity. Besides, long-(short)-lasting events are generally characterized by events of a larger (more local) scale. Therefore, 2-day precipitation sums might depend on the synoptic settings. When these settings correspond to a large pressure gradient, high wind speeds are also present. In short, the correlation between 2-day precipitation sums and 2-day maxima in wind speeds could be explained by the synoptic setting. Except for CAPE, daily maxima give no higher correlation coefficients than 2-day maxima.\\

% The highest correlations between the maximum hourly precipitation sum of wet-days only and the other variables, are those of maxima in T (0.412), TD (0.402). Also contributing, but less importance are correlation of FHmax(0.23) and RHmax (0.171) with Pmax. For intensity the relation with Tmax is even a bit higher (0.423), but for TD, FHmax and RHmax lower (respectievely 0.384,0.175 and 0.088).
Till now we used Pearson coefficients, which indicate the strength of linear relationships between variables (REF method). However, what if some or most of the variables depend in a non-linear way on each other? In order to investigate the type of relationship (i.e. linear or non-linear) we plotted the point clouds of all possible relations for wet 2-day maxima in T, TD, CAPE, FH and P (Figure \ref{fig:pointclouds}).\\
% In order to study better linearity/monoticity of the relationships, we just plot the maxima of the important variables against precipitation maxima.

Figure \ref{fig:pointclouds} confirms the linear relationship between (maxima in) T and Td, which we already suggested in this section. Multiple point clouds indicate semi-exponential and exponential relationships. With semi-exponential we mean that both a linear shape, and an exponential shape can be recognized in the point cloud. This is the case for 2-day maxima in P in relation tot 2-day maxima in T or Td. On contrast, the 2-day maxima in CAPE relate to all other variables clearly in an exponential way. The 2-day maxima in FH relate to P and CAPE maxima in a more exponential way, while the relations with 2-day maxima in T and Td do not have a distinctive form. Nonetheless, it is apparent that linearity can not be assumed for most of the relationships. Besides, another assumption for Pearson correlation coefficients is normal-distributed variables (REF method). In Chapter 3 (REF CH3) we already observed non-normal probability density functions for all hours and 2-day maxima in P. In contrast to the Pearson correlation, the Spearman rank correlation does not assume normal-distributed data or linearity of relationships (REF method).\\

Figure \ref{fig:Spearmanheatmap} shows two heatmaps of Spearman rank correlation coefficients, one for all wet 2-day maxima of all variables, except CAPE, and one for the variables in relation to CAPE for De Bilt only. As shifting to a daily maxima did not result in improvement for the previous Figure, we do not include daily figures for this approach.\\

\end{figure}

The Spearman correlation coefficients are all lower than the Pearson correlation coefficients for wet 2-day maxima, except for those corresponding to the possible relations with FH 2-day maxima, the relations between the different precipitation maxima (P, PI and Psum) and the linear relation between T and TD 2-day maxima (Figure \ref{fig:Spearmanheatmap}). %Whether these relationships are found linear is based on \ref{fig:pointsclouds_2}
The wind speed is both for 2-day precipitation sums, and for 2-day maxima in P and PI the strongest explanatory factor (coefficients of 0.37-0.47). It can be explained that the Spearman correlation coefficients are not higher in general than the Pearson correlations, although the relationships mainly seem to be non-linear. Especially the 2-day maxima in CAPE correlate relatively weakly with precipitation maxima (0.07 and 0.1 with P and PI), However, the Spearman approach is more correct from a statistical point of view. As we expect Spearman correlation coefficients to be stronger for daily CAPE maxima, we plotted these also in Figure \ref{fig:CAPE_sp}. The correlations are indeed higher for the daily resolution compared to the 2-day resolution, even 2.5-3 times. Nevertheless, we want to explain changes in 2-day precipitation maxima, so we can only conclude that the influence of the 2-day CAPE maxima is likely to be not that high regarding the strength of the relationship. \\

To summarize, we find relatively high correlation coefficients for the factors T, Td, CAPE and FH of which we know from theory to have a major influence on precipitation changes. These correlations are stronger for the extremes in these variables than for all-hour values. Different forms of relationships (linear, exponential, combination of both) are recognized by point clouds. %2-day T and Td maxima relate in a semi-exponential form to precipitation maxima. CAPE and FH 2-day maxima have a distinctive exponential relationship with precipitation maxima. With respect to 2-day P, the Pearson correlations are higher for T and Td 2-day maxima (cor=0.33 and 0.36 respectively),than the Spearman correlations. This approach considers the strength of linear relationships. The Spearman correlations describe non-linear relationships and are much higher and the highest of all explanatory variables for 2-day maxima in P corresponds to the 2-day maxima in FH (cor=0.4). Despite of the exponential dependency between 2-day CAPE and precipitation maxima, corresponding Spearman correlations are lower than the Pearson correlations.
Most of the relations are not purely linear, so that Spearman rank correlation coefficient is a better correlation statistic than the Pearson correlation coefficient. Following 2-day maxima FH, the order of strength regarding the Spearman rank correlation with 2-day maxima in P (of which significant trends are found in Chapter 3 REF) is: TD (cor=0.3), T (cor=0.2), and lastly CAPE (cor=0.07).\\


\subsection{Trends in key variables}
\label{subsec:trends}
% Mean (max) over station --> detect common signal

In this section we investigate whether the key variables, wind strength, CAPE, temperature and dewpoint temperature, regress in time. First, we plot the probability density functions in order to choose the appropriate method(s) of trend analysis for each variable. Ordinary least squares is applied on normal distributed data and quantile regression on both normal and non-normal distributed data. Second, we plot the fitted quantile and ordinary least squares lines. In order to detect the common trend for these variables, we have averaged the 2-day maxima over the 5 stations.
% ! (The resulting trends are then compared based on their appearance and rates to the trends in 2-day maxima in hourly precipitation intensity. ; if we add relative trends in Chapter 3 and here) (and frequency of wet hours and 2-day precipitation sum)
We do not differentiate on summer and winter trend in the trend analysis. However, in Section \ref{subsec:changdist} we will consider seasonal dependency next to time dependency of the different relationships. Note that trend analysis on 2-day CAPE maxima is applied for the time period for which CAPE data is available (1993-2015) and is not averaged over stations, as only CAPE data from de Bilt is available. We do not study in depth the historical changes in instrumentation and measuring sites for the key variables as we did for precipitation, due to the time restriction of this research. Third, we apply a significance test on the trends.\\

% The similarity in type and magnitude of a detected trend determines the likelyhood of an explanatory mechanism.

\newpage
All the probability density functions shown in Figure \ref{fig:pdfall} are computed from the 2-day maxima between 1958-2015, except for the probability density function of the FH maxima. Before the automatization of wind speed measurements (in 1993) data was not rounded to 1 m/s. As two types of data (rounded and non-rounded) give a strange appearance of the probability density function, we decided to only plot the 2-day FH maxima measured from 1993 onward. However, the form of this probability density function is not different from the probability density function consisting of all FH maxima. \\

The 2-day maxima in FH, T and TD are distributed approximately in a normal way, compared to the 2-day maxima in CAPE which are distributed in a non-normal way (Figure \ref{fig:pdfall}). For this difference in probability density functions, we only apply least squares on the 2-day maxima of FH, T and TD. Note that the probability density function of wind speed is not entirely symmetric. For 2-day CAPE maxima we apply ordinary least squares regression on the yearly means 2-day maxima, which are normal-distributed. For all data we study the quantile regression fits on the 2-day maxima. As precipitation extremes are stronger correlated to the extremes in the explanatory factors, the trends in the higher quantiles are the most interesting. The results of the trend analysis for the 4 variables are listed here.\\

First, Figure \ref{fig:Trends_FH} presents quantile and ordinary least squares (OLS) fits for 2-day maxima in wind speeds and the corresponding rates. A negative signal is detected for the 2-day maxima in FH. For the period 1958-2015 the OLS fit on the maxima has the exact same negative slope coefficient, -0.014 m/s/yr, as the 50\%-quantile regression line  (Figure \ref{fig:yr_rates_FH}). % 0.014/8.75*100 = -0.16% /yr   = for 58 years -9.1%
Additionally, we again find higher slopes for the higher quantiles and the strongest trend for the 95\%-quantile (-0.02 m/s/yr). % -0.02111111/17*100 = -0.124183  = for 58 years -7.2%
It is worth noting that Figure \ref{fig:yr_rates_FH} shows that the 99\% quantile regression fit has a relatively  wide confidence interval, so there is high uncertainty for this fit. \\


Although the decreasing of the wind speed for the Netherlands is consistent with the study of \citep{Smits2005}, the reason for the negative signal not investigated in this thesis. It might have to do with changes in the position of the jet stream. A decrease in FH is not expected to explain the increase in P, as we know from theory that high wind strength (as component of strong wind shear) favors extreme precipitation via storm development and faster propagation of frontal systems over a certain site (Section \ref{subsec:theory}). However, wind shear can also exist when we have weak surface winds and strong upper-level winds. Besides, back-building or occlusion events are associated with weak winds and can involve high hourly amounts of accumulated precipitation at a specific location (as described in Section \ref{subsec:theory}). On the contrary, the correlation of the precipitation maxima was highest with maxima in FH.\\

Second, we studied the trends in temperature for the same period, of which the results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Trends_T}. In contrast to FH, positive quantile and ordinary least squares (OLS) trends are found for the 2-day maxima in T (Figure \ref{fig:QR_2dT}). What is more striking, is that for the quantile lines the general rule, namely that for the higher the quantile we have a stronger trend, is not applicable here. Figure \ref{fig:yr_rates_T} demonstrates that the weakest slope is detected for the 75\%-quantile (0.025 $^{\circ}$C/yr). Nonetheless, the strongest slope is detected for the highest (99\%) quantile (increase in 2-day maxima of 0.06 $^{\circ}$C/yr), % 0.05563636/27.5*100*58 = 0.2%/yr = for 58 yrs  11.73%
. Besides, not only the 90\%- and 95\%-quantile lines have a stronger slope than the OLS line, but also the 25\%- and 50\%-quantile lines. \\

The OLS of the 2-day or yearly means T maxima gives an increase of approximately 3.5 $^{\circ}$C/century, which is almost four times as high as the global rate in temperature for this time period (\ref{subsec:theory}). % 0.034 / 12.75 * 100 = 0.27%/yr = for 58 yrs 15.5%
Note that we only consider temperature extremes (i.e. 2-day maxima) measured in the Netherlands, and we know from Chapter (INTRO REF) that local extremes can increase faster than the global average.
The relative rates vary between 0.23-0.30 \%/year. Rates are higher for the northern coastal region compared to the southern inland region of the Netherlands.  \\

Third, we applied trend analysis on the 2-day maxima in TD (see Figure \ref{fig:Trends_TD}). From Figure \ref{fig:QR_2dTD} we can deduce that 2-day maxima increase in time for the period 1958-2015. The ordinary least squares line has a slope coefficient of 0.025 $^{\circ}$C/yr, which is larger than most of the other fits. Only two quantiles have stronger slopes, the 25\%-quantile and the 95\% quantile. Remarkably the slope of the 25\%-quantile is the highest, namely 0.031 $^{\circ}$C/yr. % 0.03058824/9*100 = 0.34 %/yr *58 = 19.7%
However, the confidence interval is relatively wide for the lower quantiles. Nevertheless, the lower boundary of the confidence interval is always above 0.012, so these trends are significantly positive.\\

% CHECK yearly mean dist
Finally, we repeat the quantile regression fitting for 2-day CAPE values measured between 1993 and 2015 for station De Bilt. From Figure \ref{fig:CAPEqr_yearly} we can deduce that CAPE values in De Bilt have decreased for this period. The ordinary least squares of the yearly mean in 2-day maxima has a negative slope of approximately -10 J/kg/yr (Figure \ref{fig:yr_rates_CAPE}), %= 2.9%/yr (intercept +- 350), is for 23 years, 66% decrease
which is stronger negative than the lower (25\%- and 50\%-) quantiles, but weaker negative than the higher (75\%-,90\%-,95\%,99\%) quantiles. The strongest trend is found for the 5\% highest 2-day CAPE maxima with a decreasing rate of 42 J/kg/yr. The highest quantile lines (90-99\%-quantiles) are summer trends, as the winter CAPE values do not exceed 500 J/kg, this is shown in the next section (Section \ref{subsec:changdist}). \\

Furthermore, we can observe that the higher the quantile, the larger the confidence interval. The reason for this is that a lower samples size belongs to a higher quantile, which enhances the uncertainty in the regression fit. At the end of this section we will investigate the significance of all the different quantile regression lines for all variables. \\

Nonetheless, we want to emphasize that the observed negative trends in CAPE are not able to explain the observed positive trends in precipitation intensity. From theory we know that high CAPE values express the potential of strong updrafts, which are required for convective systems with intensive summer precipitation. On the contrary, we only consider trends in CAPE for the period 1993-2015 here, which can not be fully compared to trends in precipitation maxima for the period 1958-2015. Furthermore, the decreasing resolution of CAPE measurements could also influence a negative signal. All in all, we can not draw conclusions about the validity of the observed negative trend and the likelihood of this trend to be the cause of the trend in P.\\

% (? Maybe include: Other research also shows decrease in this period for CAPE;
% - from Riemann-Campe et al 2009  (ii) Splitting of the time series reveals a sign change in trend commencing at the end of the 70s; this is observed in parts of the tropical continents and North America. CAPE and CIN show trends of opposite sign with CAPE increasing in the first half and a decrease during the second half (and vice versa for CIN).
% - Gettelman et al,2002 : [1] Time series of convective available potential energy (CAPE) calculated from 15 tropical radiosonde stations indicate mostly positive trends in CAPE during 1958–1997.

In order to investigate the significance of all trends, we conduct a 9999 Monte Carlo permutation test. For wind speed (FH) and CAPE we tested whether the observed slope is significantly lower than all randomly permuted slopes in order to detect a negative trend, while for temperature (T) and dewpoint temperature (Td) we tested it vice versa in order to detect a significant positive trend. \\

Table \ref{tab:p_rates_all} gives an overview of the significance of the trends. A red (green) marking of a cell indicates a decreasing (increasing) trend significant at the 95\% confidence level (CL). All the linear and quantile regression trends are significant, except for the 99\%-quantile of 2-day maxima in FH (p=0.94), of which we already discussed the large uncertainty by its confidence interval.\\

% INCLUDE summer and winter trends ???
% maybe not, already considered in next paragraph
% then discuss why not in beginningn of section

In short, in this section we detected significant (99\% CL) negative trends in wind speed and CAPE and significant (99\% CL) positive trends in temperature and dewpoint temperature for the ordinary least squares regression fits and almost all quantiles fits. For wind speed the type of relation (positive or negative) with precipitation intensity is ambiguous and for CAPE a negative trend is not expected to explain the trend in P. However, whether this trend is truly negative for the period 1958-2015 is doubtful regarding the data which is limited in time length and contains a decrease in resolution in time.
%it is should be tested whether the negative signal corresponds to the positive signal in P via more back-building or occlusion of precipitation systems, as
%Combining the observed sign of the trends in the key variables with theory about their relationship with extreme precipitation, only changes in
The changes in temperature and dewpoint temperature remain as potential causes of the trends in intensification of precipitation.\\


\subsection{Seasonal and temporal differences in relations}
\label{subsec:changdist}
% IMPROVE, two periods
%Here we bundle data, as we divide all p

\subsubsection{Introduction}
In this section we zoom in on seasonal and temporal differences in relationships between maxima in the key factors (T, Td, FH, and CAPE) by comparing summer and winter season and a begin (1958-1986) and an end period (1987-2015). For every variable we plot the relations between the maxima in hourly precipitation sums and other variables as point clouds differentiating on summer and winter. We also present the summer and winter frequency distributions of the variables. Furthermore, we plot binned summer and winter quantile regression to express changes in precipitation maxima as a function of changes in the other maxima. In case of temperature and dewpoint temperature we compare the quantile regression lines to a Clausius Clapeyron scaling. For each of the three figures per relationship we compare between the first and second time period, in order to answer the question whether the changes in precipitation are caused by the changes in statistics of the key variable in question or by a changes in the relationship with that key variable. As binning and differentiating on period and season lowers the resolution greatly, we chose to use the daily maxima instead of the 2-day maxima. This section is ordered per variable.\\

\newpage
\subsubsection{Temperature}

In figure \ref{fig:PvsT}A the precipitation maxima (of wet days only) increase with maxima in temperature in a non-linear way. Clear differences are visible between winter and summer. The winter precipitation are generally lower and the points slope more gently with respect to temperature maxima. Both the summer and the winter data resembles a triangle shape, with a monotonic increase till approximately 25$^{\circ}$C summer temperature and 10$^{\circ}$C winter temperature and a decrease after these maxima. \\

% The distribution of the maxima is clearly dependend on the season. Therefore, differentiating between summer and winter provides a more detailed understanding of changing distributions and/or relationshio.

For both periods the seasonal characteristics and overall shape are visible, but there are also differences between the point clouds. On the one hand, the first period has more outliers ($>$ 32 mm/hr for summer data, $>$ 12 mm/hr for winter data), on the other hand the second period has more (and higher) summer intensities at temperatures $>$ 30 $^{\circ}$C and winter intensities at temperatures $>$ 10 $^{\circ}$C. \\

To investigate the influence of the temperature distributions on the shape of the point clouds, we plotted the summer and winter distributions of temperature for each period (Figure \ref{fig:PvsT}B). In Figure \ref{fig:PvsT}B for each bin of 2 degrees Celsius the number of wet hours per season per period is counted. Summer and winter distributions for both periods have similar Gaussian shapes with a temperature difference of 12$^{\circ}$C between the peaks. More wet hours exist in winter than in summer, explaining the magnitude difference between the winter and summer distribution. \\

For the first period the peak in number of winter data per bin is at 6-8 $^{\circ}$C, while the summer peak is around 16-18 degrees Celsius. For the second period the winter peak is shifted to a higher bin (to 8-10 $^{\circ}$C). Although, the summer peak is not shifted towards a higher bin, the bars after the peak are relatively higher for the second period compared to the first period. \\

As the temperature distributions have a Gaussian shape, the chance on an extreme in intensity are highest for the middle bins with the highest numbers of data per bin. However, the point clouds do not only have a triangle shape, but they are also tilted towards a positive relationship between P and T. Besides, the maxima in summer and winter precipitation intensity in Figure \ref{fig:PvsT}A are for higher temperatures than expected from the distributions.\\

In order to remove any influence of how the temperature is distributed on its relation with precipitation intensity, we computed the mean summer and winter precipitation maxima for each temperature bin with more than 200 samples. In Figure \ref{fig:PvsT}C the solid lines connect these means. Moreover, the 95\% and 99\% quantile lines are plotted as dashed and dotted lines to visualize the temperature relation with \enquote{high} extremes in precipitation. Mind the logarithmic scale of the y-axis. The mean and quantile lines are compared to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling, to find out whether this precipitation-temperature relationship can be deduced directly from the CC equation, or whether other dynamics are involved.\\

From Figure \ref{fig:PvsT}C can be deduced that the mean and quantile lines quite nicely follow the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (of which the scaling is given by the black lines with the same style in linetypes). With a thin black lines a super CC-scaling (twice what is expected from the CC equation) is indicated. Only for some parts, such as the 95\% and 99\% quantile lines for temperatures higher than 15 degrees, a super CC-scaling is found. What is striking is that this also holds for the winter mean and quantile lines for temperatures lower than 2 degrees for the first period. It might be still influenced by the amount of data in a bin. Significant differences between summer and winter P-T relationships are not found. \\

When comparing the two periods little differences are present for the upper parts of the winter and summer mean and quantile lines. The winter lines regress further (in a flat way) with respect to temperature for the second half compared to the first half. This is explained by the shift in the temperature distribution to higher winter values. The upper parts of the summer mean is less deviating from the CC-scaling and the upper parts of the quantile lines are relatively more aligned with the super CC-scaling. Nevertheless, changes in the distribution are more clearly visible for this time period comparison than changes in the P-T relationships.\\

In this section we investigated changes in the point clouds, distributions and binned mean and quantile lines for dewpoint temperature (Td) between the two seasons and time periods (Figure \ref{fig:PvsTD}). For increasing dewpoint temperature we observe the same monotonic increase of precipitation intensity as for temperature. Besides, more outliers are present in the first half of the time period, while a shift is visible from relatively high counts of low winter and summer intensities in the first half to relatively high counts of high winter and summer intensities in the second half. As we know from Section \ref{subsubsec:correlationmatrices} that temperature and dewpoint temperature have a strong linear relationship, these similar features for T and Td are not unexpected. However, regarding the binned mean and quantile lines for dewpoint temperature, relatively more parts are scaled to the super CC-scaling, compared to temperature. Nonetheless, regarding the comparison of the two time periods, no notable changes in the relationship between P and Td are detected, while the dewpoint temperature distribution clearly shifts towards higher dew point temperatures.\\

  \label{fig:PvsFH}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, we investigated whether the summer and winter point clouds, distributions and mean and quantile lines of the maxima in wind speed (FH) change in time. Although, we already know from Section \ref{subsec:trends} that its uncertain whether the general long-term trend in FH maxima can explain the change in P, it is still interesting to analyse the seasonal and temporal differences.\\

In Figure \ref{fig:PvsFH} we plotted the result. Clear differences between summer and winter can be seen from Figures \ref{fig:PvsFH}A,B; summer is recognized by relatively high precipitation maxima and low wind speeds, while for winter it is vice versa. This could correspond to a seasonal difference in sign of the relationship between P and FH. In summer weak surface winds favors intense precipitation via back-building of convective systems under condition of sufficient wind shear, while in winter strong surface winds favors intense precipitation via fast propagation of frontal systems. Additionally the summer distribution has a more asymmetric shape with a more pronounced peak compared to the winter distribution. Considering the time-related change in distributions we do observe small decreases in the frequencies of winter maxima, but we do not for the frequencies of summer maxima. \\

Figure \ref{fig:PvsFH}C shows the change in the P-FH relationship. Although, the CC- and super CC-scaling do not have a physical meaning here, they are plotted so we can better compare the regression of the mean and quantile lines with the same regression for temperature and dewpoint temperature. What is striking from this figure, is that we indeed observe a sign difference between summer and winter in the P-FH relationship. With negative (first period) to constant (second period) slopes for the summer regression fits of P over FH, and positive slopes for the winter regression fits. \\ % Regarding the slope of the lines we can observe that large parts are aligned with the exponential CC-scaling, and some parts with the super CC-scaling. This only applies on winter mean and quantile lines, not on the summer lines. Nonetheless, in general the slope is highest for the lower wind speeds (mean). lower for the 95\%-quantile, compared to the mean, and for the 99\%-quantile compared to the 95\%-quantile.

When considering the transition from the first to the second period we observe in \ref{fig:PvsFH}A,B a decrease in the FH maxima, which is seen in (1) a reduction of the maxima in number of outliers in summer precipitation maxima (which was also observed in the T and Td plots), (2) an increase of the frequencies of relatively weak summer wind speeds and (3) a slight lowering of the summer bars corresponding to the higher wind speed maxima. From \ref{fig:PvsFH}C we deduce that there are less summer precipitation maxima for high wind speed maxima (pink lines do not extend further for temperatures $> 11^\circ$C). Moreover, the summer regression provides a less negative P-FH relationship in time. The winter regression lines are for a larger part aligned with the CC scaling in the second period compared to the first period.\\
%As the maxima in wind speeds weaken in time (Section \ref{subsec:trends}), this could in combination with a time-related change to a more positive summer P-FH relationship, lead to increase in P.   with higher P for relatively high wind speeds
%and winter mean and quantile lines have weaker slopes of the regression line of P over high FH.

Regarding the decrease in summer precipitation outliers in time, we do not expect that when the trend in wind speed is leading to higher P, this is a summer trend. Despite of a negative trend in the overall wind speeds, it could be that an intensification of the winter P-FH relationship explains the positive trend in P. Although, the latter can be related to faster propagation of frontal systems with higher wind speeds,  we can not draw conclusions whether changes in FH have caused the intensification of precipitation.\\

 % Nonetheless, a physical explanation for intensification of precipitation due to decreasing wind speeds is not known from theory.


\subsubsection{CAPE}

Finally, we would like to discuss changes in CAPE maxima and their relationship with precipitation maxima. However, we only have CAPE data from 1993 till 2015. Therefore, time comparison is not possible. Moreover, we only have data for De Bilt, so the resolution is too low to do the same binned plotting for precipitation maxima over CAPE maxima. \\

In Figure \ref{fig:PvsCAPE} we have plot the summer and winter point clouds, providing information about the seasonal P-CAPE relationship, and the distributions of summer and winter CAPE maxima. The values of CAPE maxima are very seasonal dependent, as can been deduced from Figure \ref{fig:PvsCAPE}. Winter data are confined to low CAPE maxima of $<$ 500 J/kg and low precipitation intensity maxima of $<$ 10 mm/hr, whereas summer data has weak to high CAPE maxima (up to 5000 J/kg). For both seasons a highly asymmetric (lognormal) distribution can be detected, although the summer distribution is wider in shape than the winter distribution.\\

\newpage
\subsubsection{Summary}

To summarize, we found strong seasonal differences in relationships between precipitation and T, Td, FH en CAPE maxima and in the distributions for each variable. In general, in summer we have relatively high daily maxima in temperature (mainly between 12-24$^{\circ}$C), dewpoint temperature (most values between 9-20$^{\circ}$C), and CAPE values (mainly between 0-2500 J kg$^{-1}$) and relatively low daily maxima in wind speed (2-12 m/s) compared to winter daily maxima (respectively 0-14$^{\circ}$C,-2 - 12$^{\circ}$C, 0-500 J/kg, 2-18 m/s). \\%Time related changes in distributions show a

Positive exponential relationships, comparable with CC (and partially super CC) scaling, are found for binned summer and winter P-T and binned winter P-FH mean and quantile lines. Summer and winter maxima in mean hourly intensity are similarly sensitive for changes in temperature and dewpoint temperature, except for the highest (summer) intensities which are less sensitive to increases in (dewpoint) temperature. Winter maxima in wind speed are more aligned to CC scaling than summer maxima.\\

When comparing the second half of the time period to the first half, the P-T and P-TD relationships are slightly more aligned to the CC-scaling, while the P-FH quantile lines are less aligned from the CC-scaling. Moreover, the P-T and P-TD are as strong or stronger for the more extreme P maxima (95\%- and 99\%-quantiles), compared to the mean P maxima. This is vice versa for the P-FH relationship. However, for all three variables the timewise shift in distribution from higher summer and winter T and TD maxima and lower winter FH maxima is more clearly visible than changes in their relationships with P. So, changes are more related to changing statistics than to changing dynamics.\\

Due to the ambiguous relation between wind speed and precipitation, we can not draw conclusions on whether the negative signal in FH explains the positive signal in P (Section \ref{subsec:trends}). If this would be case, then it might have to do with faster propagation of frontal systems in winter associated with weak surface winds. \\

In contrast to FH, we expect that the changes in precipitation are likely influenced by changes in the distribution of temperature and dewpoint temperature. A shift to higher temperature and dewpoint temperature is then linked in an exponential way, shown in Figures \ref{fig:PvsT},\ref{fig:PvsTD}C by the alignment with CC- to super CC- scaling, to higher precipitation intensities.
The increase of temperature leads to an increase of the moisture holding capacity (expressed in Td), which leads to an intensification of precipitation extremes. This also holds with the detected negative trend in the frequency of wet hours. Air is less quickly saturated at higher temperatures, consequently there are less (2-day) hours in which saturation is reached.\\
